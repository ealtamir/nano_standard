              The Gini coefficient measures volume distribution within the Nano
              network. A Gini close to 1 means only a few transactions take up
              almost all the volumne, possibly meaning Nano is only used for
              speculative purposes. A Gini close to 0 means the volume is
              distributed more evenly, meaning Nano is being used for more
              everyday transactions by lots of people.
