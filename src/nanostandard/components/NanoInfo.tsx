        Welcome to NANO standard, a website dedicated to tracking the evolution
        and adoption of Nano as a worldwide money standard. To understand Nano's
        progress, we monitor several key metrics that provide valuable insights
        into its growth and usage:

              As Nano gains wider exposure and adoption, its price is likely to
              appreciate relative to fiat currencies and precious metals,
              signaling increased demand and utility.

              Both absolute transaction volume (in Nano) and equivalent fiat

              A steady increase in send confirmations suggests that more users

              The Gini coefficient measures volume distribution within the Nano
              network. A Gini close to 1 means only a few transactions take up
              almost all the volumne, possibly meaning Nano is only used for
              speculative purposes. A Gini close to 0 means the volume is
              distributed more evenly, meaning Nano is being used for more
              everyday transactions by lots of people.

              Over time, the Gini coefficient should trend closer to 0,

              its role as a currency.

              Account balances show how much Nano (and equivalent fiat value)
              users are willing to hold. The distribution of these balances
              helps us understand if Nano is being used as intended - as a
              practical currency rather than just a speculative asset.

              Over time, we should see a healthy distribution of account
              balances across different sizes. A mix of smaller everyday-use
              accounts and medium-sized savings accounts would indicate that
              Nano is serving both as a practical medium of exchange and a
              reliable store of value.
